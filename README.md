# Newton Raphson solve system of equations and Regression models.

## Problem definition
Find the solution of system equations stastified contraints given bellow:

![System of equations]()

## Features

### 1. Solve the system of equations given ```T2, ER```
.
```bash
python
```

```math
a^2+b^2=c^2
```



### 2. Plot the representation graph given $T_2$ value.

### 3. Regression the representation equation for $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_6$.

### 4. Lack of fit test
